Bartending machine capable of creating cocktails received from a mobile application

## Message to devs
Different components of our project have been organized into the obviously named directories
/web_client (NISHAT)
/mobile_client (KEVIN)
/web_server (KEVIN)


Amir/Johnny you can add a directory for your hardware/pi_server code as you please.

## Startup (directed at Nishat)
To get started with the React app you'll need to follow these steps

0. Open up **Node Command Prompt** (not git bash or regular cmd)

1. From the ```root``` directory, you'll want to navigate into the ```/web_client``` directory

  ```cd web_client```

2. Install the node modules you need, you only need the command

  ```npm install```

3. When that's done, you can just start the app with

  ```npm start```

4. The above step should've opened your browser to ```localhost:3000```. If not, you can open it yourself.
